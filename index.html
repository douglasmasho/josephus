    <h1>The Josephus problem</h1><br>

    <p>
        A group of Jewish soldiers were captured by the roman army, they wanted to avoid capture or suicide. So they came up with a system. They would stand in a circle
        and the first man wiould kill the man to the left of him, and the next remaining living man would kill the next remaining living man. The pattern cotinues until there is only one person left,
        The last man standing will have to commit suicide. Josephus preffered capture to suicide, but he didn't want to tell the other soldiers else they would turn on him. He wants to know what position in the circle he should 
        stand in order to survive. In Josephus' case there were 41 soldiers in the circle(including josephus). In the mathematical problem there were n people. Where is the winning seat. 
    </p>

    <p>Open the console the solve the problem<br>
        Run the function josephus with any n(number of people). The function will output the position(p) that josephus must be in to survive<br>
        example: josephus(8) ---> returns 1</p>
